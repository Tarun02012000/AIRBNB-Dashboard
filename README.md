Airbnb Data Analysis Dashboard ‚Äì Power BI Project
This interactive Power BI dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of Airbnb listings across major cities. The project was designed to explore patterns in pricing, availability, neighborhood popularity, and city-wise distribution to derive actionable business insights.

üìä Project Overview
The Airbnb Dashboard was built using publicly available Airbnb listing data. The goal was to clean, model, and visualize the data to:

Understand how listings are distributed across different cities

Identify top 10 performing neighborhoods based on number of listings

Analyze price trends and availability

Track room type preferences and review scores

Generate city-wise insights to support data-driven decision-making

‚öôÔ∏è Tools & Skills Used
Power BI: For data modeling, transformation, and visualization

DAX (Data Analysis Expressions): For creating custom metrics and calculated columns

Power Query: For data cleaning and transformation

Data Analytics Concepts: Exploratory data analysis (EDA), KPI tracking, visual storytelling

üìå Key Features
Dynamic Filters: Interactive dropdowns to filter data by city, neighborhood, room type, etc.

Top 10 Neighborhoods Bar Chart: Automatically highlights most popular areas

City Distribution Gauge: Shows proportional breakdown of listings city-wise

Pricing Insights: Detects pricing patterns and anomalies

Availability Heatmap: Visualizes calendar-based availability trends

üßπ Data Cleaning & Transformation
Removed missing/null and zero-price entries to improve data quality

Added custom columns for city labeling and price categorization

Standardized date formats and cleaned location-based data

üìà Outcome
This project helped me sharpen my Power BI skills in building a fully functional dashboard from raw data, focusing on user interactivity and visual clarity. The dashboard can be utilized by property owners, data analysts, or business stakeholders to derive meaningful insights for market positioning and pricing strategy.
